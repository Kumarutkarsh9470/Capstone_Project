# Capstone_Project
Overview

This project implements an end-to-end dynamic pricing solution for urban parking lots. It:

Performs extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on parking occupancy and related features.

Engineers domain-specific features (occupancy ratios, rolling averages, vehicle type encoding, special-day flags).

Implements three pricing models:

Baseline Linear: Price adjusts incrementally based on occupancy ratio.

Demand-Based: Uses a weighted demand function incorporating occupancy, queue length, traffic, and special days.

Competitive-Aware: Factors in competitor prices to optimize local pricing.

Simulates real-time data ingestion and processing using Pathwayâ€™s streaming API.

Visualizes live price trajectories with Bokeh and Panel.

Tech Stack

Architecture & Workflow

Data Loading: The CSV file is loaded and parsed into a Pandas DataFrame, combining date and time into a single Timestamp column.

EDA:

Missing values and distributions are analyzed.

Temporal trends (occupancy ratio over time) and spatial patterns (if geodata available) are visualized.

Correlation matrix to identify key drivers.

Feature Engineering:

Occupancy Ratio: occ_ratio = Occupancy / Capacity.

Rolling Averages: occ_roll3 over 3 half-hour intervals.

Special-Day Flag: Binary encoding if a given day has special events.

Vehicle Type Encoding: One-hot encode vehicle categories.

Model Implementations:

Model 1 (Baseline Linear): Sequential price updates based on occupancy.

Model 2 (Demand-Based): Demand signal = weighted sum of features; price scales from a base.

Model 3 (Competitive-Aware): Combines demand price with competitor pricing input.

Real-Time Simulation:

Pathway streams the half-hour records at a controlled rate.

Tumbling Window: Daily windows aggregate max/min occupancy to infer demand fluctuation.

Price Computation: Window outputs feed Bokeh updates continuously.

Visualization:

The delta_window table is bound to a Bokeh plot via Panel.

Live line and scatter glyphs show daily dynamic prices as the stream runs.
